                  It is my privilege and honour to be here with us.
                </p>

                  My name is Rabbi <br />
                  Dr. MAS and I am a Son of God!
                </p>

                <p>
                  Some years ago, the Lord started taking me through a series of lessons that was geared towards expressing the God-Life, and living the normal supernatural life of the Believer.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I have been privileged to see some miracles that may look like they were downloaded from the internet, to someone who hears them...
                </p>

                <p>
                  I have seen short limbs grow out, I have seen twisted spines straightened, I have seen blind eyes opened, I have seen cripples walk, I have seen new kidneys, hearts and livers given to people on their death bed and watched them rise up, I have seen cancers healed and watched metal disappear from people's legs..(Most of them with medical evidence)
                </p>

                <p>
                  The Lord spoke to me many years ago and said 'If you are alone doing the things you do, the Church will tag you and say you have a gift of healing. So I want you to get a few people and teach them what I have taught you. By the time those people start doing the same things you do and even more, it will be clear that it is not a gift, but a principle!'
                </p>

                <p>
                  I have done many supernatural and glory meetings and seen Believers step into all kinds of crazy expressions. God is not interested in One-man superstars.  
                </p>

                <p>
                  Sometime ago, the Lord started speaking to me about raising a next generation of Generals. A people that I can mentor directly and teach them all that the Father taught me (and is teaching me, for I am still a learner) ...

                  If you are in this group, then your hunger has singled you out.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I hope you know, that Elijah did not climb the chariot, and then remove his mantle and fold it to drop for Elisha. It was Elisha's hunger that literally dragged the mantle from Elijah
                </p>

                <p>
                  If you are here, I want to say I love you.. Those of you that I have had a personal contact with, know that. Some who I have not had the privilege to meet yet, will know that..
                </p>

                <p>
                  Above all, it is the Love of God that compels us.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The more you think you don't have any gift of the Spirit, the more qualified you are to be here..
                </p>

                <p>
                  'Why bother with the apparent lack of gifts if you have the Giver'? 
                </p>

                <p>
                  You have God and its time to let Him out!
                </p>
